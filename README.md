This is a school project for my Simulation class.

The goal of the class is to learn how to  model and simulate systems, so for
this I choose to do a basic simulation of how packets are sent through networks.

My work is based greatly on the "Networking Tutorial" by Ben Eater on YouTube.
Great tutorial!

Due to the amount of time available to complete the project we are keeping it 
as simple as posible.
